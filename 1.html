The WebFonts Working Group has published WOFF File Format 2.0 as a W3C Recommendation.
Based on experience with <strong>WOFF <u>1.0</u></strong>, which is widely deployed,
this specification was developed to provide improved compression and
thus lower use of network bandwidth, while still allowing fast decompression
even on mobile devices. <p style='margin-top:50px;'></p>This is achieved
by combining a content-aware preprocessing
step and improved entropy coding, compared to the Flate compression
used in WOFF 1.0. Read more in the W3C Media Advisory.
